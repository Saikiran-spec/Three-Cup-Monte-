# Three-Cup-Monte-
The Three Card Monte (often called Three Cup Monte when played with cups) is a street gambling game that is often used as a scam. In the game, a small object (usually a ball or pea) is hidden under one of three cups or cards, which are then shuffled quickly by the dealer.The player is asked to guess which cup or card contains the hidden object after the shuffle.
The game is designed to deceive, as the dealer typically uses sleight of hand to manipulate the cups or cards in a way that makes it nearly impossible for the player to guess correctly. It is illegal in many places due to its fraudulent nature, as it relies on trickery and manipulation rather than chance.
Game Difficulty: You could make the game more challenging by increasing the number of cups or adding more complex animations.
User Interface: Adding a more visually appealing interface with custom icons or a more intricate layout could improve the game's look and feel.
Score Tracking: Implementing a score system (e.g., counting how many tries it takes to find the ball) could make the game more competitive and engaging.
